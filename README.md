# Fun with Fractions

## Overview

This project implements a fraction-based calculator with interactive and quick modes. It supports basic arithmetic operations on fractions, stores values in registers, and handles input via both REPL and command-line arguments.

## Classes

1. **BigFraction**: Handles fractions with `BigInteger` for precision and supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **BFCalculator**: A calculator that stores the last computed value and performs operations on fractions.
3. **BFRegisterSet**: Manages 26 registers ('a' through 'z') for storing fractions.
4. **InteractiveCalculator**: A REPL interface for interacting with the calculator.
5. **QuickCalculator**: A command-line interface for quick fraction calculations.
